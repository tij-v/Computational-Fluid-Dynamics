Simulation in C to capture the conduction of heat on 1-D and 2-D walls, respectively. For calculations we implement the 1-D and 2-D Heat equation, respectively.
In the first task, I compare the efficiency of various computation methods, viz:
1. Crank-Nicolson
2. DuFort Frankle
3. FTSC Implicit
4. FTSC Explicit, 

on a 1-D wall, with plots as a visual guide for accuracy. 

In the second task, I use the said techniques to display dissipation of heat across a 2-D wall; again, verfied by 2-D plots for times 6 minutes and 24 minutes, respectively.
